# Simple Node.js CRUD API Project Overview

## Project Description
This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built using Node.js and Express. It is designed to demonstrate the best practices in developing and maintaining a production-ready API server. The project serves as a practical example for interns and new developers to learn about the fundamentals of API development, collaborative software development processes like Git workflow, and other best practices in coding, reviewing, and deploying code.

## Architecture Overview
The API follows a simple server layout optimized for clarity and maintainability:

### Directory Structure
- `/src`: Contains all the source code.
  - `/api`: Dedicated directory for API-specific functionalities like routes.
  - `server.js`: The main server file where Express app is set up and all middleware is configured.

### Main Components
- **Server Setup**: Configured in `src/server.js`, it includes middleware setup and basic route initialization.
- **Middleware**: Security and logging middleware are integrated to enhance security and provide insights into API usage.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Code Reviews**: All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one peer before merging to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Pull Requests**: Should be small to facilitate easier review, and must include a summary of changes and the purpose of the update.
- **Testing**: Contributors are expected to add tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass before submitting pull requests.

This project is not just about building a functional API but also about adhering to industry best practices in software development to prepare interns and new developers for real-world software development challenges.
